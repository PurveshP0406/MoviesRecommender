Introduction
 
 Plan of Action
 

We obtained the open-source Big data movies dataset for this project and used Content-based and Collaborative based recommendations to produce a data frame that can be visualized on a website.

Environment Setup

1)	Install PyCharm to build the front-end of our website.
2)	Jupyter Notebook to develop the model for recommendation and python distribution platforms to build the back-end.
3)	Extract modelled files
